This is a work done in a team of 3 members, one of which was me. 
We have developed this project with an Agile methodology as it was required for the Software Engineering class 
we were participating in. Every sprint has had at least one collaborative meeting, in which each of us would give 
our coding and thinking contribution. 
The programming language we have used is C#, since we had that language in common.

The functional requirements of this project are:

1. As a prospective library user, I wish to be able to register to use the libraryâ€™s services. 
2. As a registered library user, I wish to be able to login to the library system.
3. As a library staff member, I wish to add new books, magazines, DVDs to the library catalog.
4. As a library staff member, I wish to delete lost or damaged books, magazines and DVDs from the library catalog
